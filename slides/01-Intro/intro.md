  <h2>Separation of Concerns</h2>

Let's talk about **Decoupled**, or **Headless** Drupal.

If you’ve been involved with the Drupal Community over the last couple years, you’ve heard these phrases thrown around.

This idea that back-end developers can focus on the data and front-end devs can focus on the presentation.

It's this very **clean separation of concerns**. Where one can move completely independent of the other.

In reality, a fully decoupled Drupal application takes a lot of planning and due deligence to create and maintain that clean separation.

There are cases where a fully decoupled site makes perfect sense and there are cases where decoupling would be terribly inefficient. More importantly, decoupling does not have to be a binary choice. It’s not all or nothing. The concepts and strategies of decoupling can be applied to the parts of your application where it makes most sense and ultimately makes you more productive. Where the practical solution *is* actually a decoupled approach.

Over the last year we’ve had the opportunity to put some these decoupled ideas into practice. We’ve had successes and even some missteps but we’ve learned a lot.

Today we want to share some of the lessons we’ve learned and the decisions we’ve made - some more right than others.
