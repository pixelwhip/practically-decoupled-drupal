  If you’ve been involved with the Drupal Community in the last couple years, you’ve heard the phrase Decoupled or Headless Drupal. This idea that you can leverage the content modeling aspects of Drupal to create the underlying structured data while taking advantage of the wide array of modern front-end technologies to craft a user interface.

  Back-end developers like it because they can focus on pure data, content architecture, and functionality. Front-end developers can focus on markup and interactions without worrying about the baggage of how the underlying data was implemented.  Product owners like it because they can target more platforms than the browser and make upgrades to the back-end without redesigning the front-end and vice versa.

  But decoupling Drupal isn’t always that simple. There are hidden costs. There are features of Drupal that we’ve come so accustomed to, and we take them for granted. This can lead developers into a decoupled project without fully understanding the implications. Or, on the other end of the spectrum, lead people to dismiss Decoupled Drupal as hype.

  While these concerns are absolutely valid, the gains from a decoupled architecture are real.

  Over the last year we’ve had the opportunity to put these decoupled ideas into practice. We’ve learned a lot. We’ve had successes and even some missteps.

  We’re certainly not here to convince you to go out and decouple anything and everything. There are cases where a fully decoupled site makes perfect sense and there are cases where decoupling would be terribly inefficient. More importantly, decoupling does not have to be a binary choice. It’s not all or nothing. The concepts and strategies of decoupling can be applied to the parts of your application where it makes most sense and ultimately makes you more productive. Where the practical solution is actually a decoupled approach.

  To illuminate that line, we want to share some of the lessons we’ve learned and the decisions we’ve made - some more right than others.
