## JSON API Module

**Great for:**
  - Fully decoupled
  - Documentation
  - Best-practices
  - Easy

**Downsides**:
  - Not in core... yet (we need your help!)
  - Not very configurable
  - Can't do aggregation or RPC

<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
- Install it and it “just works”
- Built for a fully decoupled architecture, impossible to “prescribe” presentation
- Your documentation is half-written for you, just refer to the spec
- Very little configuration
  - Double edged sword
- It can’t provide aggregates or non-deterministic data without custom code, this is the stuff for custom controllers

- Sales pitch
  - Can use it today (please do!)
  - On track to be an experimental module in Drupal 8.3
  - Biased, but in a year all new decoupled Drupal projects will be using the JSON API module
