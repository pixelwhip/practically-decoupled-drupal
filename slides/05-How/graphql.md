## GraphQL Module

**Great for:**
  - Fully decoupled
  - Growing community

**Downsides**:
  - Read-only at the moment
  - Moving much more slowly than JSON API at the moment

<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
- Really don't know a lot about GraphQL
- As far as I'm aware, it's still in the pretty early stages of development
- I'm really excited to see competing approaches
- I think it's really incredible that JSON API and GraphQL can both be built on top of Drupal 8
