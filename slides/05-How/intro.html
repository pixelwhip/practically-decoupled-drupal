<h1 class="heading--bigass">Decoupled Toolbox</h1>
<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
- Various technical means of communicating between client and server
- All are great for something
- All of them have tradeoffs
- Not being afraid to mix and match is a good thing
- Be pragmatic about these tools will free you to do some really cool things


- We're going to work our way down the "coupling scale"
- Some are highly coupled, the client and server need to "know" a lot about eachother
- The last method, the client has no idea that it's talking to Drupal
  -  Drupal has no idea if it's talking to a CLI, curl, or a browser
