<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
- Gone are the days of that monolithic form API page
- Never fret about #default\_value vs. #empty\_value
- Just concerned about what happend when X or Y happens and access control
- Data model is more pure
- "what is an article really?"
- Do we need that pull-quote field
- entity references upon entity references like we get w/ paragraphs or beans
