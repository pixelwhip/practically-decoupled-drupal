<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
- When and where to decouple?
- When is it worth it?
  - Form heavy sites that are heavily designed
  - Highly interactive sites where jQuery might become way too hard to manage
- I like to think about the idea of “Article driven” vs “user driven”
  - News site vs. Commerce site
    - A news site is mostly static, cacheable content
    - Meant to be read over a period of a few minutes
    - The only interaction is going to a new or related article
  - A commerce site is largely a read-only browser followed by a series of forms
    - Browsing experience should be pleasant and intuitive with no distractions
    - Checkout process should be smooth and fast with intuitive and smart forms
